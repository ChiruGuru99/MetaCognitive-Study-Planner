Important Learning Techniques

1. Retrieval Practice (The Testing Effect)
Retrieval practice is the process of recalling facts, concepts, or events from memory.
- Mechanism: Retrieval causes the brain to reconsolidate memory, strengthening connections.
- Optimal Practice: Repeated and spaced out. Effortful retrieval creates stronger learning.
- Metacognitive Benefit: Acts as a "reality check" on mastery (Calibration).

2. Spaced Practice (Distributed Practice)
Distributing study sessions across time.
- Consolidation: Gives the brain time for mental rehearsal and consolidation.
- Retention: Produces stronger, longer-lasting learning compared to massed practice (cramming).

3. Interleaved Practice
Mixing the practice of different but related topics.
- Discrimination Skills: Helps learners discriminate between different types of problems.
- Versatile Application: Boosts long-term retention and application in unfamiliar settings.

4. Varied Practice
Altering conditions or context of practice.
- Transfer of Learning: Improves ability to apply learning in new settings.
- Flexible Mental Models: Encodes learning in a more flexible representation.

5. Elaboration
Giving new material meaning by expressing it in your own words and connecting to prior knowledge.
- Mechanism: Forms more connections between new info and prior knowledge.
- Application: Relating to outside life, teaching someone else, using metaphors.

6. Generation (Generative Learning)
Attempting to answer a question before the solution is shown.
- Benefit of Error: Unsuccessful attempts encourage deep processing when the solution is supplied.

7. Reflection
Reviewing recent experiences and asking targeted questions.
- Application: "What went well?", "What could have gone better?".

8. Calibration (Avoiding Illusions of Knowing)
Aligning subjective judgment of knowledge with objective feedback.
- Illusion of Fluency: Mistaking familiarity for mastery.
- Role of Testing: Frequent low-stakes testing exposes weaknesses.

9. Mnemonic Devices
Mental tools to hold arbitrary material (e.g., Memory Palaces, Acronyms).

Self-Regulation and Planning
- Implementation Intentions (If-Then Planning): "If situation X occurs, then I will do Y." Automates responses.
- Mindfulness Meditation: Strengthens attentional control.
- Specific, Challenging Goal Setting: SMART goals boost performance.
- Growth Mindset: Believing abilities can be developed through effort.

Habit Formation
- Habit Loop: Cue -> Routine -> Reward.
- Kaizen: Small, consistent steps.
- Environment Design: Shape surroundings to reduce friction.

Focus, Deep Work, and Breaks
- Pomodoro Technique: Study 25-50 min, break 5-10 min.
- Monotasking: Focus on one subject at a time to avoid switching costs.

Expertise and Mastery
- Deliberate Practice: Focused, goal-directed practice targeting specific skills.
- Regular Feedback Cycles: Immediate correction of errors.
